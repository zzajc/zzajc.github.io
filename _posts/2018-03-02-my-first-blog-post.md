Dear reader, thank you for visiting my blog. This is my very first message that I used to initialize my blog.

For many years I was thinking about writing my own blog. Most of the ideas were already present on the web somewhere.

Many other ideas will be hidden forever as I signed multiple NDA's to protect my customers.

Finally I decided to write my ideas even though many of them are not unique. But it is often usefull to read the
same information rephrased by someone else.

It will be useful for myself too, because I want to build my knowledge base which will be accessible worldwide.

I also want to start paying my open-source debt because I would never get to the current state without all the
free stuff that smart people shared on the internet.

I would like to express the greatest gratitude for all free information that is available to all the humanity.

I hope this blog will make myself to be one of you.
